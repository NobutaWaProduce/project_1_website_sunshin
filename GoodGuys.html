    <h3>Cadis Etrama Di Raizel - Rai - Alive</h3>
    <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/1/18/Nblesse%3B_Cadis_Estrama_Di_Raizel_By_Udarsha45.png/revision/latest?cb=20120426094220" height="400">
<p>Cadis Etrama Di Raizel, or simply Rai, is the main protagonist of Noblesse. He is a Noble from Lukedonia who holds the special title of The Noblesse, which distinguishes him from all other Nobles as their hidden protector, as well as their judge, and if necessary, executioner. He is Frankenstein's master and currently attends Ye Ran High School in order to learn more about the modern human world.</p>
<p> Rai possesses no knowledge whatsoever regarding the 21st century, and often tends to be lost and confused especially when interacting with modern day technology such as cell phones and computers. Although he seems cold and apathetic on the outside, Rai has shown compassion towards human beings. Rai also has a great sense of duty as he decides to remain as "The Noblesse" whose life is even harder than that of the Lord. Rai was feared by all the Nobles in Lukedonia and had to spend most of his life by himself at his mansion. He yearned for a normal life and seeing how M-21, Tao and Takeo wanted the same thing, he wants to protect them and make sure they have what he couldn't have. He is willing to forgive traitors who have attempted to take his life, but he will punish them for harming those he sweared to protect. Rai loves the company of the human children he meets in Ye Ran. He can never bear to see them injured. He is shown to be unwilling to enter a temporary slumber even for a short time because of his uncertainty as to when he will awake and if he will get to meet the children again in the world he has come to know. Rai has a profound love for eating ramen noodles and. Rai hates his clothes getting unclean or messy which can be easily seen as he keeps them very tidy and clean.</p>

<h3> Frankenstein - Alive</h3>
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/7/7c/F1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130117092659" height="400">
<p>Frankenstein is Rai's devoted servant and has loyally served him for over 800 years. He is a brilliant scientist, whose abandoned research notes helped to bring the Union's scientific knowledge and technology to the advanced level it has reached. Frankenstein is also the founder and current principal of Ye Ran High School, where he is known to all as the Principal.</p>
<p>Frankenstein is a very loyal person, especially toward his master, but can become quite serious and calculative when the situation calls for it. Although Frankenstein has shown a sadistic side during his battles, he is also compassionate towards human beings, especially towards the students in his school. Before he met Rai and the other clan leaders, he shows hostility towards the Nobles while displaying compassion and empathy for the humans who were frequently being attacked by mutants whom were contracted to the Nobles. He accuses the Nobles of being corrupt, but eventually changes his views. His empathy for humans and human lives is known to be so great that he became a scientist of his calibre merely by experimenting on himself. He has never used humans in experiments. He is seen on multiple occasions to be extremely organized and he hates messiness, especially in his house, this trait is almost to the point of an obsession. He has been noted to be reckless, exceedingly dangerous and bloodthirsty when he uses too much of his power.</p>

<h3>M-21 - Alive</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/2/24/M21Ch182.png/revision/latest?cb=20110425153058" height="400">
  <p>M-21 is a modified human. He was unwillingly experimented upon by Dr. Crombel and the Union, leaving him with no memories of his previous life. He was originally thought to be a failed experiment until his latent powers were awakened by Rai. He currently serves as a security officer at Ye Ran High School and is a member of the group RK-5.</p>
  <p>Early in the series, M-21 was shown to be a cold-hearted, clever, rebellious experiment that often looked for trouble to ease his boredom. As the series progressed, M-21 started to become compassionate towards the very humans that he had wanted to kill for amusement. He is revealed to be a very loyal man to his comrades. He was very close with M-24 and they both shared a dream of finding their comrades' names. He has shown that he really loves the children as well, risking his life to protect them. Though he doesn't show it, he is a kind man who cares for his comrades. M-21's goal is to find out who he truly is as well as the identities of his fallen fellow experimentees. M-21 excels in provoking others to argue or fight. He practices it on a regular basis with Regis. This ability of him is put into use during his fight with Rael. He also excels in spewing diatribes and harsh words born of his directness and straight forward disposition. M-21 is generally quiet and reserved and doesn't show much emotion. But when he loses his composure, he literally 'loses it'. His nasty temper is the sort that gives rise to serious frictions no matter what consequences await.</p>

<h3>Tao - Alive</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/7/76/Chapter_110.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/240/height/240?cb=20120224152909&format=webp" height="400">
  <p>Tao is a Modified Human and a foil character of the series. He is an ex-member of DA-5 like Takeo. He switched allegiances, joining up with Rai and Frankenstein after finding out that the DA-5 group was actually created for Krantz to absorb their powers. He also convinces Takeo to leave the Union after telling him the truth. He currently works as a security official at Ye Ran High School. He is also the leader and founder of the RK-5: "No.1".</p>
  <p>He confesses to being lonely because no one understands him and his love for technology. Therefore, he found comfort in meeting Woo Ik-Han, whom shares his passion. Recently, he forms a strong comradeship with fellow ex-Union members: M-21 and Takeo. The relationship between the three has had a considerable influence on his personality; he is kinder and more social. Moreover, he is very carefree and relaxed, sociable, talkative and adaptable to surrounding environment very quickly. It can be said, however, that Tao can sometimes become too focused and absorbed in thought, leaving him to carelessly forget his surroundings, such as being approached by a member of Cerberus while aiding Takeo and M-21 at a distance, and perform inappropriate actions leading to others' discomfort or distress, such as eating all of Rai's cookies before realizing what plate he was taking from. He also takes amusement in performing pranks since he taught Takeo "crass" korean language, which causes embarrassment and regret for Takeo.</p>

<h3>Takeo - Alive</h3>
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/6/66/Takeo-snip.png/revision/latest?cb=20150102040855" height="400">
<p>Takeo is a Modified Human and the series' stock character. He is an ex-member of the DA-5, which was a special forces team of the Union. Unlike the others, he was tricked into working for the Union by Dr. Aris, who pretended to be his sister Teira being held captive by the Union. He eventually finds out the truth and switches sides along with Tao, joining Rai and Frankenstein. He currently works as a security official at Ye Ran High School. He is a member of the RK-5 and his codename is 'No 2'.</p>
<p>Takeo cares deeply about humans, which can be observed in the fact that he treats younger kids with a high amount of compassion because of his memories with his "sister". He demonstrates his kinder nature by giving M-21 water when the former experiment is imprisoned and tortured by the members of DA-5. He also enjoys mingling with citizens around the area in which his team currently operates in, though he is quickly chastised by his teammates for doing so. Takeo seems to be a good-natured person and only does what is necessary in order to keep his sister safe from the Union. After he is disillusioned from Dr. Aris' lie and comes to join Frankenstein's household, he freely shows his softer, albeit more regretful, nature with his newly found comrades.</p>

<img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/f/f5/SeiraJRoiard.png/revision/latest?cb=20110418155800" height="400">
<p>Seira J. Loyard is a Noble and is one of the eight current Clan Leaders of Lukedonia. She is one of the Noble residents of Frankenstein's household and a student of Ye Ran High School. She is also the newest member of the RK-5.</p>
<p>Seira is quiet and straightforward, and speaks only when she deems necessary. She is a fast learner as after a just a few lessons, becomes solely responsible for making the meals in Frankenstein's house, with the one exception being ramen, a dish in which Frankenstein is the sole undertaker. Seira does not shy away from responsibility, and has undertaken the role of Lukedonia's representative when interacting with both the Union and the KSA.</p>

<h3>Regis - Alive</h3>
<img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/e/e2/RegisLandegre.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110706231217" height="400">
<p>Regis lives by the code of the Nobles and protects humans although it was believed that his father was killed in a situation orchestrated by some of them. He is very particular about elegance and often chides his enemies for lacking class. He displays the characteristic stubbornness of the Landegre clan and reacts emotionally when provoked. Due to his grandfather's no-nonsense, strict and very conservative upbringing, he is no-nonsense and conservative as his grandfather, Gejutel.</p>

<h3>Rael - Alive</h3>
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/6/6f/Rael.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110111153359" height="400">
<p>Rael Kertia is a Noble and the current clan leader of the Kertia Clan, one of the seven serving the current lord of Lukedonia. He is the son of Ragar Kertia and the younger brother of Rajak Kertia. He is Season 3's main antagonist.</p>

<h3>Karias - Alive</h3>
<img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/e/e7/Karias_smile.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20140123075751" height="400">
<p>Karias is an eccentric and unorthodox individual even among the nobles. He seeks opportunity to bask in glory and likes to brag about himself - a running gag of the story being Karias proclaiming to be Raskreia's younger brother. Karias is very cordial towards most women (with the exception of the 5th elder). Although he appears carefree and happy-go-lucky most of the time, he nurtures deep thoughts regarding nobles and their lifestyle. He shares with Regis his concerns over the nobles being stagnant and dominating others with just power. He believes that Regis and Seira are beings who will bring change to the world of nobles. The previous Lord liked Karias (seeing that his attitude is not like a noble) and thought that he reminded him of his own youth.</p>
<img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/2/25/Karias1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120731042843&path-prefix=pl" height="400">
<h3> Rajak - Dead</h3>
<img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/5/5f/Rajak1.png/revision/latest?cb=20110530161349" height="400">
<p>Rajak moves with an air of dignity. When he is ordered by the Lord to go to the human world and bring Seira back, he is irked by it, but gets ready to obey the lord. Being convinced by his younger brother that the work does not suit his dignity, he lets Rael do it instead of him. He is loyal to the Lord and executes anything he has been bidden to do without question. His sense of duty is astounding. Even after seeing that his brother has been using a soul weapon, he gives it less priority and chooses to first complete his mission assigned by the Lord. Later, it is shown that this is due to the fact that he already knows about Grandia. He has also been shown to have great respect for the other clan leaders. Besides that, when Rael informed him about Regis being present among the intruders in the forbidden area, he told his brother to be absolutely sure before coming up with such stories.</p>
