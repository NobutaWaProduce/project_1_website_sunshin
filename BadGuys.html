        <h3>Dr. Crombel - Alive</h3>
        <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/9/9d/Crombel.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140130141421" height="400">
        <p>Dr. Crombel is a recurring antagonist of the series. He is a high ranking scientist of the Union who has been promoted to the rank of the 13th Elder after being recognized by Elders for his talents. He is also in command of the Assassination Squad, members of which have infiltrated into almost every sectors of the Union and are acting as Crombel's eyes and ears.</p>
        <p>As a mysterious scientist with hidden agenda, Dr. Crombel does many unpredictable things. Though he's in the Union, he sometimes conducts research which he keeps secret from the Union. He also likes to observe things that other people do in order to gain more knowledge and pass time. He is a pure scientist in that all he cares about is whatever data he can discover through experiments. Pain, suffering, high mortality rate, decreased life span, opinion, basic human rights, and anguish of those he experiments on only concerns him in what data he can get out of it. He likely considers ethics and morals as impediments to research and a waste of time and energy. Other than research, his focus and pleasure centers on acquiring power, exclusive knowledge, and removing those he considers enemies or obstacles. However, he seems to enjoy taking his enemies out by manipulating, outsmarting, and using indirect means rather than direct confrontation so his enemies either don't know he's behind their downfall, or can't prove his involvement even if they do figure it out. His desire for power has been shown through his mental link with Mary of the Assassination Squad, and when he had all the personnel within a lab killed (researchers, janitors, EVERYBODY) so he'd have exclusive knowledge of some data he discovered from Jake and M-24's infected.</p>
        <h3>Maduke - Alive</h3>
        <img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aYFZuQ_ltuo/V5b6iObTZNI/AAAAAAAUIo8/ZvCRhbUhQ_0/s0/noblesse-417-v04-pic-21.jpg" height="400">
        <p>Maduke is a very keen sighted person and he doesn't trust others including his loyal subordinates ex: Kentas who was put under surveillance when he expressed his displeasure against the use of Garda as an experiment specimen. Maduke doesn't mind sacrificing the members of his race if it leads to the growth of his strength. Maduke is a cold and patient person who believes himself to be the one true Lord of the Werewolves. He waited for centuries to remove Muzaka from his position as the Lord. Maduke believes that the only way for long lasting peace to exist is that the world should be ruled by the strong and the war is just a way to achieve that.</p>
        <h3>Yuri - Alive</h3>
        <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/3/30/Yuriy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130518113854&path-prefix=pl" height="400">
        <p>As Dr. Aris' personal assistant, Yuri is shown to be a very organized, prompt, and punctual man, speaking in a polite tone and who is completely loyal to Dr. Aris. He handled all her political affairs and paperwork, even collecting "souvenirs" on her behalf that specifically fit her taste. However, this image and "loyalty" is later revealed to be false with the revelation that his true allegiance lies with Dr. Crombel, on whose behalf he frequently spied for.ï»¿ His true personality is that of a manipulative, serpentine, and insidious man but he frequently hides this behind a fake smile and polite tone, in order to fool people. He is also very intelligent, correctly deducing that Tao and Takeo had survived and had probably joined forces with Frankenstein. He has a habit of frequently correcting the position of his glasses while talking. Yuri also appears to have connections with many top tier members of Union, as he is shown to be closely familiar with 10th Elder and 11th Elder. After meeting Seira in the Elders' and Nobles' official meeting, he has developed an one-sided infatuation with her. Such an infatuation, however, does not make him any more friendly or less murderous.</p>
        <h3>Lagus Tradio - Dead</h3>
        <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/a/a7/Lagus-387.png/revision/latest?cb=20160104153710" height="400">
        <p>On the surface, he would appear as a very respectful individual but underneath it, his true character is of a person with quite an ambitious, scheming, treacherous and cunning personality. He also appears to enjoy doing different kinds of tasks that he deems interesting do to his apparent free time. Due to the fact that he has existed for what seems to be eons, he has tendency to speak in a very archaic manner. He wished to rule the world with nobles being the supreme power but after fusing with the Blood Stone, the stone turned into him a power hungry monster who desired to consume life force from all the living beings including nobles.</p>
        <h3> Dr. Aris - Alive</h3>
        <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/anime-characters-fight/images/c/c4/Noblesse_-_Dr._Aris_(1).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150325083320&path-prefix=ru" height="400">
        <p>She has a twisted personality and is impulsive to the extreme. She initially presents herself with an innocent, child-like demeanor, but is very cruel when it comes to experimenting on humans. She also doesn't care about her experiments and made them use their life energy while fighting which could kill them. For example, she tells her assistant, Yuri, to collect "souvenirs". These "souvenirs" are humans that Dr. Aris would experiment on. Dr. Aris is also very demanding and psychotic; after the capture of Frankenstein, Frankenstein attempts to leave but is threatened by Dr. Aris who demands that he withdraw his leg from the door frame threatening to cut his leg. She can get extremely angry when she is disobeyed, like when Frankenstein leaves against her wishes, she orders her human-machines to eradicate him. She doesn't have much respect for her higher officers as she kept insulting Dr. Crombel and even the 12th Elder.</p>
        <h3>Gradeus - Dead</h3>
        <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/e/e8/Gradeus_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20151021100223" height="400">
<p>Gradeus is a Noble and a previous Clan Leader of Lukedonia. He is one of the six Noble Clan Leaders who declined to enter the Eternal Sleep with the previous Lord, and then betrayed the current Lord about 500 years before the start of the series. He joins the surprise attack to Lukedonia. When he betrayed Lukedonia and deserted his clan, he discarded his clan surname as well: hence he is called only as Gradeus. He has no children.</p>
<p>He is spiteful and savage; which is typically far from characteristics expected from a Noble clan leader. Even werewolves are aware of his moniker "The Berserker". He seems to revel engaging in battles. His bloodlust is rather evident as he's eager to get into a fight, doesn't hesitate to eliminate the opponent and ravage the defeated even after death(ravaging and violating the dead are usually employed for terror tactics, which might not necessarily be used for amusement. Gradeus, however, seems to genuinely enjoy the barbaric deed). Although easily enraged, he can manage to sit out a battle when convinced. Gradeus is self-confident, almost arrogant to an extent, as he belittles the abilities of opponents and even his comrades. He also seems to possess such a distorted view of nobles' code of honor as nothing more than self-complacent hypocrisy, as he harbors a deep grudge against Ragar and certain Nobles for acting loyal and having a strong sense of morality. Despite this view, he is shown to have once been a close and loyal follower of Raizel, who is an embodiment of the noblesse oblige, as with the other Traitor Clan Leaders. Their relationship was evidently and surprisingly quite amicable.</p>
  <h3>Gayare - Alive</h3>
  <img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dg-B41cQUPA/V85TpP_5eSI/AAAAAAAVBYw/TCHqoUuFuBg/s0/noblesse-423-v04-pic-29.jpg" height="400">
  <p>Gayare accompanies Juraki to South Korea in secretly following Kentas. They observe that Kentas has been aimlessly roaming around with a modified human. After a couple of days of observation, Juraki decides to take action and Gayare follows him. They appear in front of Kentas and M-21. Gayare is ordered to finish off the modified human - M-21. A battle follows where Gayare is temporarily overpowered because he let his guard down, having underestimated M-21. He becomes flustered again and again as M-21 gradually reveals his powers. After his opponent thrashes him and almost flees (but for the intervention of Urne and Mirai), Gayare starts to take the battle seriously and transforms into his werewolf form to get rid off M-21. Urne and Mirai assist by creating a barrier so that humans in the vicinity do not get involved. Gayare is about to finish off M-21 when Juraki spares his life as he decides to take the modified human captive with them out of curiosity.</p>
  <h3>Ignes - Alive</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/d/d7/Ignes-414.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20160711173958" height="400">
<p> Ignes appeared a cheerful person on the outside. But beneath her smiling demeanor lies an extremely demented and egocentric personality that even her father cannot fully control. Deprived of being the Clan Leader due to her father's continued existence, she is enraged that the current Clan Leaders, her juniors by hundreds of years, possess powers she only dreams of having. That has led to her developing an obsession over physical modification in order to enhance her abilities. She is also shown to be a megalomaniac, expressing her desire to reign over all walks of life on earth.</p>
  <h3> Drakon - Dead</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/f/f1/Drakon_378.png/revision/latest?cb=20151102151824" height="400">
  <p>Drakun is a warrior who enjoys to hunt stronger opponents. He is extremely loyal to his Lord and for him he didn't hesitate to compromise with his principles. The physical enhancement he got influenced his personality as he got drunk on the power and thus lost the advantage he had with his long training.</p>
  <h3>Urokai - Dead</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/1/16/6th.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130306174112" height="400">
  <p>Urokai is very talkative, highly jealous, bitterly angry, spiteful, expresses negative emotions in a very strong and explosive manner. It is revealed that he betrayed Raizel out of feeling unappreciated and jealousy. Urokai accused Raizel of displaying indifference toward those who followed him (including Urokai); yet he took Frankenstein, a puny mortal, under his wings over other nobles. Furthermore this feeling was strengthend by the fact that Raizel would kill the members of his own race for the sake of humans. So Urokai agreed to eliminate his former master to 'correct' him of his 'wrong' path. However, when Raizel declared that he respected traitors' deeds because that was their will, even though it was an act of treachery, Raizel responded in his usual stoic, tepid manner, which enraged Urokai even more. It can be assumed that at this point, Urokai is also an attention-seeker.</p>
  <h3>Rotics Kravei - Dead</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/6/62/Roctis.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120501084532" height="400">
  <p>In Frankenstein's flashback, Roctis appeared to show reverence to Rai and cared much for his well-being. When he met Frankenstein, he was shown to be very direct in warning Frankenstein should he do anything to betray Rai's good trust. However, he, along with other traitor clan leaders, betrayed both Rai and the previous Lord. The reason as to why would such a loyal vassal to the Noblesse betray him remained a mystery. His concern for Rai pales in comparison to his love for his own daughter. In order to protect Ignes, he can sink to the point that he is willing to betray the Lord, the Noblesse, as well as his own race. Before death, he admits he has to abandon his nobility, clan, all other nobles, even his own mind and body to protect his daughter. Even within the Union, he did all he could to prevent Ignes from being in a powerful position to restrain her atrocious and uncontrollable nature - he had declined the 13th Elder position offered to Ignes. As the 4th Elder of The Union, Roctis has been shown to be extremely calm in all situations. He was also fine with entering into a contract with the 12th Elder.</p>
  <h3>Zarga Siriana - Dead</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/f/f8/Zarga_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20140120151258" height="400">
  <p>Although apparently serious in his mannerisms and courteous to those who he does not consider his enemies, he can be judged as a cold-blooded murderer after he explains his murdering of previous Loyard leader. He commented upon the Loyard leader's last plea to him to restrain from killing humans as 'pathetic'. He uses respectable tone during his conversation with KSA unlike 5th. He also seems to have his own sense of pride as he does not approve of interferences in battles as he initially lost interest in fighting Seira after the 8th interference and also was unsettled by the 5th elders desire to interfere in Rajak and the 8th elders battle.</p>
  <h3>Edian - Dead</h3>
  <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/0/01/Edian.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151013141245" height="400">
  <p>Edian is a reserved individual. She doesn't take pleasure in tormenting her opponents unlike her peers. When it comes to Rai, she will actually do anything. Her devotion was deep seeing as she did what she believed could free him from his duty as the Noblesse. Her unchanging love for Rai was strong enough to the point that she sacrificed herself to save him from Lagus' deadly blow, even while she was under the latter's control. She can also be very protective of Rai as shown in a flashback wherein she is questioning Frankenstein's indefinite stay, and even outwardly threatens to kill him in case something bad happens to the Noblesse.</p>
  <h3>Mary - Dead </h3>
  <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/3/32/Mary2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110215064945" height="400">
  <p>Mary is very intelligent, always strictly follows her missions and loyal to Dr. Crombel. She rarely displays emotion and is usually quiet, which frequently annoys Jake, her partner. Although she is often overshadowed by Jake's frequently outrageous actions due to her stoic, avoid-trouble-if-possible disposition, she has a very cold and contemptuous nature, and harbors arrogant superiority complex toward M-21 and 24, seeing them as unworthy "trash". When she died, everyone in the Union, including the members of the DA-5, showed surprise. They all found it hard to believe that she could have been killed.</p>
<h3>Jake - Dead</h3>
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/noblesse/images/b/b3/Jake.png/revision/latest?cb=20110107184746" height="400">
<p>Jake is very egotistical, aggressive and sociopathic, which gets him scolded by Mary. Jake is extremely reluctant to heed Mary only because she seems to have more power than him. He loathes being experimented on, unless he, himself, ordered it. Jake also swore to take revenge on Mary and Dr. Crombel, who always tended to look down upon him. Jake has also been shown to have the ability to transform, which gives him an even greater amount of speed and strength. He thinks very little of failed experiments such as M-21 and M-24. He revels in brutality shown in his involvement of elimination of everyone in the hospital.</p>
